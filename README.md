# Smart-lock-using-RFID
This project is about a smart lock system that uses RFID technology to control access. The system consists of an RFID reader, an Arduino microcontroller, a lock, LCD, and a buzzer. The RFID reader is used to read the RFID tags that are associated with authorized users. When an authorized user approaches the door, the RFID reader reads their tag and sends the tag's ID to the Arduino microcontroller. The Arduino microcontroller then checks the tag's ID against a list of authorized users. If the tag's ID is found in the list, the Arduino microcontroller sends a signal to the lock to unlock and shows on the lcd who opened the lock. If the tag's ID is not found in the list, the Arduino microcontroller sounds the buzzer to alert the user that they are not authorized to access and shows on the lcd “access denied”.
The smart lock system is a secure and convenient way to control access. It is more secure than a traditional lock because it is not possible to copy an RFID tag. It is also more convenient than a traditional lock because users do not need to carry a physical key. They can simply use their RFID tag to unlock the door.
The smart lock system can be used in a variety of applications, such as homes, businesses, and schools. It can also be used to control access to restricted areas, such as laboratories and data centers. The system is easy to install and use, and it is relatively inexpensive.
